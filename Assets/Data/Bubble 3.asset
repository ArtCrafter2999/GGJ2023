      it: you feel sick because of the poison in the roots. It had to make you kill.
      Otherwise you would be killed, so you had no choice. And I increased the dose
      every time you went higher. It should`ve convinced you that being closer to
      the surface and farther from me is dangerous. But now, I just don`t need you.
      You are like a broken toy, but you are funny, so I`ll give you a chance. If
      you survive, I will allow you to go to the surface.'
